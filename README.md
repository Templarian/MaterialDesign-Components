### Web Components

Web Components with a very basic wrapper. The only magic is...

- `@Prop() foo = 'Hello World`;
  - Calls `this.render()` on change.
- `@Part() $foo: HTMLDivElement;` = `<div part="foo"></div>`
  - `this.$part.innerText = 'Hello World!';`
- `@Local('default') foo;` Shorthand for localStorage.
